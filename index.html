		<p>As of March 2023, Xbox Chaos has been retired. A compiled archive of tutorials and downloads from the site can be found on <a href="https://archive.org/details/xboxchaos_archive">Archive.org</a>. Assembly is still being supported.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The latest published Assembly build can be found on Github <a href="https://github.com/XboxChaos/Assembly/releases/latest">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Latest development Assembly builds (potentially unstable, you should keep it separate if you care about automatic updates) can be found on Appveyor <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ThunderWaffle/assembly/build/artifacts">here</a>, though these builds only stay up for 30 days, so this link may appear empty at times.</p>
