NOTE: Some Xbox settings will be reset after updating and will need to be set again.
Poking errors should be more descriptive.
Original Xbox poking and screenshots now supported. (Requires Debug BIOS)
Console poking now uses a custom implementation that replaces the previous XDevkit.dll dependency.
Screenshots likewise use a custom implementation, allowing native resolution shots to be taken and to apply accurate gamma values for Halo 3 and ODST.
PC poking will now attempt to fall back to latest info if an unknown game version is encountered. Will be mentioned that it did if any errors occur.
Stubbs Remaster poking now supported."
